# Security Policy

Security means a lot, also for this library, and we want to make sure there is no flaws in it. That's why we rely on you, the open source contributors, to inform us about actual and possible security vulnerabilities. Please follow the guideline below to get in touch with us, even if you're not sure, if your issue is regarding the data security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities, as GitHub issues are publicly accessible!!!

Instead, contact us per mail (fredrik1206@gmail.com), or contact us through [Github's security](https://github.com/fredrikj31/toggle-kit/security) section.

Thanks for your cooperation and your understanding.
